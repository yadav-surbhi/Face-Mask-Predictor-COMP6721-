# AI Mask Prediction

The aim of this project is to train a network to distinguish between three classes using PyTorch. The classes are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Person with Face Mask</li>
<li>Person without Face Mask</li>
<li>Not a Person</li>
</ul>

List of files:
<ol>
<li>DataManager:<br> This class is responsible for loading the data and preprocessing it. In here we we preprocess alage the images and change its size.</li>
<li>Model : <br> This class defines the Model as well as trains and test the models.</li>
</ol>

The required dataset for the project is present in Database Folder.

To run perform the following steps:
<ol>
<li>In terminal locate the the project folder</li>
<li>Execute the Model.py file using command python3 Model.py</li>
</ol>

or 
<ol>
<li>Import the projec in respective IDE</li>
<li>Execute the Model.py</li>
</ol>
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
